       "{'BTC': ['Bitcoin (BTC-USD) surged above $35,000 in its largest single-day jump in 13 months, fueled by optimism that regulatory approval of the first spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund is nearing. The world’s largest cryptocurrency moved up more than 10% Monday, its biggest increase over a 24-hour period since September 2022. The price reached its highest point in a year and a half. The stocks of digital asset companies also pushed higher. Coinbase (COIN), the largest US crypto exchange, opened 13% higher Tuesday while MicroStrategy (MSTR) rose 12%. Bitcoin mining firms Riot Platforms (RIOT) and Marathon Digital (MARA) surged more than 13% and 17%, respectively. The rally appeared to be driven partly by speculation that the Securities and Exchange Commission was close to granting approval for a spot bitcoin ETF, which would allow investors to get exposure to the cryptocurrency without having to own it. BlackRock (BLK) is among the money managers that have recently applied to launch such a product. Bitcoin backers pointed to the listing of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust on the website of clearing house Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC), while also cheering a suggestion that BlackRock had begun seeding the fund. Speculation about BlackRock also drove prices higher last week when a rumor circulated that the SEC had granted its approval for the spot bitcoin ETF. Prices pulled back when BlackRock denied it. Investors expect the agency will rule on the applications by Jan. 10. There is another factor behind this week’s price swings, according to crypto market data aggregator Coinglass. Over the past 24 hours, $231 million worth of levered positions on bitcoin have been liquidated by investors, 80% of which were short the digital asset. The dramatic movements over the last few weeks have some in the crypto community celebrating a return of the enthusiasm that',\n",
       "  'One approval and the dominoes will fall. That’s the dogma driving expectations for a U.S. spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). If only the industry’s bogeymen at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) would approve that one application, approvals will snowball, institutional cash will flood in, and all will be right in the world of the blockchain. That goal appeared to edge a step closer Monday. The SEC confirmed it will not contest a court decision in favor of digital asset investment firm Grayscale’s right to convert its GBTC (Grayscale Bitcoin Trust) into a spot Bitcoin ETF. Bitcoin was up over 19% for the past seven days on the back of the news, sitting above the US$34,000 support level as of 2.30 p.m. Wednesday in Hong Kong, according to CoinMarketCap data. The coin briefly broke US$35,000 during Tuesday trading, its highest level since May 2022. A Grayscale spokesperson said that the company now hopes to “work constructively” with the SEC on its efforts to convert GBTC — currently the world’s largest cryptocurrency fund with US$16.7 billion in assets under management — into a spot Bitcoin ETF. “GBTC is operationally ready, and we intend to move as expeditiously as possible on behalf of our investors,” the spokesperson said. But it’s not just Grayscale investors who are waiting for a U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF. The financial instrument — which would allow investors a way to invest in the coin on a traditional exchange — is seen as a way to open up the still marginal world of crypto investment to traditional finance. “You’re going to have a lot of people getting into crypto by the way of an ETF,” said Jack Jia, head of crypto at payment platform Unlimit. He said the primary benefit of a spot Bitcoin ETF is that it',\n",
       "  \"Arthur Hayes, the co-founder of the BitMEX derivatives exchange, published an essay attributing the crypto market rally to the costs associated with hawkish U.S. foreign policy and not spot Bitcoin ETF anticipation. In an Oct. 24 essay titled The Periphery, Hayes attributed U.S. president Joe Biden’s open-ended commitment to supporting Israel’s war effort against Hamas to the recent surge in the crypto markets. “Added to Ukraine’s tab, America’s military budget is set to truly explode,” Hayes said. “This will increase future government borrowing, and the sky's the limit when it comes to the sums of capital a war can waste.” Hayes said institutional investors already moved to sell off bonds and treasury bills in preparation for expanded U.S. military expenditure and will be seeking returns from new asset classes. “If long-term U.S. Treasury bonds offer no safety for investors, then their money will seek out alternatives,” Hayes said. “Gold, and most importantly, Bitcoin, will begin rising on true fears of global wartime inflation.” Hayes’ comments come after BTC surged 19.5% in seven days, with many pundits attributing the move to progress on BlackRock’s application for an exchange-traded fund (ETF) investing spot in Bitcoin. The combined capitalization of digital assets is up 12.6% over the same period. Hayes noted that gold has been rallying since the conflict broke out in Gaza. Gold is up 8.6% since Oct. 4, last changing hands for $1,975 per ounce, according to Market Index. Read the original post on The Defiant\",\n",
       "  'While crypto investors remain fixated on the possibility of a spot Bitcoin ETF launching sooner rather than later, the decentralized finance sector has staged a quiet rally, with many tokens outperforming both BTC and ETH. The market capitalization of DeFi assets is up 15% to $49.4B, a three-month high. Similarly, total value locked (TVL), a measure of the amount of assets deposited in DeFi protocols, has crossed $40B for the first time since August. In terms of deposits, decentralized exchange Sushi, cross-chain protocol Thorchain, and DAI-focused lender Spark outperformed in October, with TVL up 32%, 25% and 22%, respectively, over the past week alone, according to Defillama. It’s been a stellar week for BTC, with the world’s most valuable cryptocurrency up 7% in the last 24 hours and 18% in the past week. The action has been driven by speculation that BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF may be around the corner. Bitcoin rallied above $35,000 for the first time since May 2022 before paring some gains. According to a chart from David Lawant of FalconX, yesterday’s short liquidations were the biggest in the past year. Kwenta, a perpetuals trading protocol operating on Optimism, an Ethereum Layer 2 network, saw its token surge 43% in the past week. Meanwhile, Thorchain’s RUNE and oracle provider Chainlink’s LINK are up nearly 40%. DeFi stalwarts AAVE and LIDO have rallied 32% and 22%, respectively, and DYDX is up 29% as the perpetuals exchange gets closer to launching its own Cosmos-based appchain.

       "  'Bitcoin jumped more than 12% to $35,000 Tuesday, its highest level since May 2022. Bearish crypto traders have lost roughly $178 million over the last 24 hours, a CoinDesk report showed. Speculation around approval of a spot bitcoin ETF has fueled a rally across bitcoin, ether, and other tokens. Bitcoin jumped as high as $35,200 on Tuesday, catching bearish crypto traders by surprise with a CoinDesk report showing $178 million in losses over the past 24 hours. The world\\'s largest crypto by market capitalization had surged more than 12% Tuesday on speculation for the potential approval for an exchange-traded fund based on the spot price. After hitting its highest level since May 2022, bitcoin later pared some gains to trade around $34,440 by midday in New York. CoinGlass data illustrated that Monday saw $400 million of crypto liquidations, with around half of that coming from bitcoin-tracked futures. A liquidation takes place when a partial or complete loss of margin leads to an exchange closing out a trader\\'s leveraged position. In effect, bitcoin\\'s rally meant many traders could not maintain the margin requirements on leveraged bets. Binance, Huobi, and OKX each saw liquidations of $50 million, CoinDesk reported, which implies a large amount of leveraged bets on those platforms. Optimism has percolated for several weeks in the digital asset space, with financial mainstays like BlackRock, Fidelity, and VanEck submitting applications to launch spot bitcoin ETFs. GrayScale Investment, meanwhile, notched a recent legal victory against the Securities and Exchange Commission\\'s attempt to prevent it from converting its bitcoin trust into a spot ETF product.

       "  'Bitcoin hit $35,000 on Tuesday, its highest since May 2022, amid hopes of a spot ETF approval. Optimism surrounding the ETF approval has been driving a bitcoin rally, which is up 107% year-to-date. An approval would be a big win for crypto advocates, letting investors into the industry without having to own bitcoin. Bitcoin jumped as much as 11.5% on Tuesday to hit $35,000 amid hopes that regulatory approval for a long-awaited ETF is on the way. It later pared gains to about $34,200 but bitcoin is up 28% this month alone and 107% year to date — a major comeback from its precipitous drop in 2022. Optimism in the crypto market has been building for weeks after financial titans like BlackRock, Fidelity, and VanEck filed applications with the Securities and Exchange Commission to sell spot bitcoin ETFs. Further fueling the excitement was Grayscale Investment\\'s recent legal victory against the SEC\\'s attempt to block it from converting its bitcoin trust into a spot bitcoin ETF. While regulators have already approved bitcoin futures ETFs, a spot ETF will essentially create a tradeable item tied to the current price of bitcoin. Crypto advocates hope a spot ETF would allow many more investors to participate in the industry without actually owning bitcoin. Billionaire crypto bull Mike Novogratz said last week that he sees spot ETF approval going through this year. On Monday, Bloomberg Intelligence\\'s ETF analyst Eric Balchunas flagged on X that an \"iShares Bitcoin Trust\" has been listed on the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation website, a company that clears securities transactions. —Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) October 23, 2023 \\xa0 While it doesn\\'t mean the ETF is actually trading yet, such preparations were seen as bullish signs that regulatory approval may be imminent.

BlackRock's proposed bitcoin ETF is still under regulatory review by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Asset manager Fidelity Investments is also in the race to offer such products. Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst Eric Balchunas flagged on X that the iShares Bitcoin Trust “has been listed on the DTCC” with the ticker IBTC. “This doesn’t mean it’s technically approved,” Balchunas said in an interview. “It’s not home free.

Growth was driven by Hermès’ Europe and US customers with sales up 20% in Europe and 18% in the Americas. Hermès said that its European arm was boosted by the loyalty of local clients and the “dynamics” of tourist flows. Hermes shares traded up 2.5% in mid-morning trading. “Hermès is managing to defy the economic headwinds thanks to price hikes which don’t appear to be weighing on customer demand,” Victoria Scholar, head of investment at Interactive Investor, said.

       "  'Early Consensys employees are alleging that Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin cheated them out of equity in the Brooklyn-based company. The former employees allege in the lawsuit filed Thursday that Lubin persuaded them to abandon their careers and join Consensys taking lower salaries, with the promise they would receive equity in what Lubin vowed would become the \"crypto Google.\" Lubin said these early workers would receive equity in what he referred to as the “hub” of the conglomerate of Consensys, which was founded in 2014. However, these promises were broken, the plaintiffs say. \"Plaintiffs in an ongoing shareholder case against the Swiss-based web3 incubator and investor Consensys AG, which operates as Consensys Mesh, have just filed suit against U.S. blockchain software developer Consensys Software Inc. in New York state court,\" Consensys said in a written reply to a request for comment from The Defiant. \"After two years of getting nowhere with their frivolous claims against Consensys Mesh in a Swiss court, plaintiffs now believe their meritless claims stand a better chance of yielding a pay day if they game U.S. courts and entangle Consensys Software and other unrelated parties in litigation. We fully expect that the plaintiffs, who were never employees of Consensys Software, will soon find this gambit is another fruitless attempt to enrich themselves from the success of others,\" the statement said. Consensys was created to develop and expand the Ethereum blockchain. It has been largely successful in its ambition and is currently a driving force in Ethereum development, with its star product MetaMask, the most widely used non-custodial wallet.

       "  \"Vitalik Buterin hasn’t taken any profits on his personal stash of ETH since 2018, according to a post from the Ethereum founder on Warpcast, a decentralized social media platform. While Buterin rarely comments on his personal transactions, the clarification comes after large ETH transfers from his Ethereum wallet to centralized exchanges – nearly $4M worth of ETH in September alone – were widely covered by news outlets. Founders cashing out their tokens is usually seen as a bearish signal, generally indicating a lack of confidence in their projects’ future prospects. ETH is down nearly 6% in the past two weeks after trading above $1,700 at the start of the month. On Oct. 17, Buterin revealed some of his biggest concerns for Ethereum's future and shared insights on the progress of Layer 2 development in an AMA session hosted by Dan Romero, co-founder of Farcaster, another decentralized social platform. A scenario in which crypto remains stagnant while the focus of technological innovation shifts further to AI could potentially pose a threat to Ethereum, he said, adding that he’s suspicious of the incentives driving big players in the sector. When asked what keeps him motivated, Buterin spoke about the unique position of the Ethereum community in building technology that can bring significant value to an increasingly complex world. Reflecting on Ethereum’s development path and the decision to favour an expanded Layer 2 ecosystem over sharding at the Layer 1 level, Buterin said that the core team was focused on the network’s transition to proof of stake consensus at the time, and that he believes that the infrastructure to support Layer 2s would not have developed as quickly if Ethereum had pursued sharding. He went on to say that there is a ‘counter-movement’ emerging to bring more standardization across the Layer 2 ecosystem,\",\n",

       "  \"eETH, the highly-anticipated liquid staking token from EtherFi, is now live on Ethereum’s Goerli testnet ahead of its Nov. 6 mainnet launch. Liquid staking tokens (LSTs) allow holders to access exposure to staking rewards without operating a node, and can also be used in DeFi protocols to generate extra yields. eETH differentiates itself from competitors by also offering holders exposure to restaking yields via EigenLayer. “Staking with eETH on EtherFi automatically restakes on EigenLayer and accrues staking rewards while allowing users to use eETH in other DeFi protocols,” EtherFi said. “No other liquid staking protocol has this capability.” EtherFi added that its technical architecture uses sharding to ensure that stakers retain control over their keys, whereas node operators generate the keys for rival LST protocols. eETH’s impending mainnet launch comes as Lido, the top LST provider, is facing increasing criticism over refusing to self-limit its staking. According to Dune Analytics, Lido’s validators control 31.6% of staked Ether’s supply. Danny Ryan of the Ethereum Foundation recently warned that any singular entity amassing a third of Staked Ether poses “a systemic threat to Ethereum.” “At a third, if someone served those three operators at Lido… and they say ‘shut it down’, then we have an issue with liveness,” Ryan said. “It's where we begin to potentially have issues.” On Oct. 13, EtherFi announced it will implement measures to self-limit its staking dominance at 25% of both the staked Ether’s supply and Ethereum’s validator headcount into the protocol’s smart contracts. EtherFi has attracted around 18,000 ETH since beginning its staged rollout in April. “We think it's irresponsible to not commit to self-limiting,” Mike Silagadze, the founder and CEO of EtherFi, told The Defiant. Lido’s dominance is down from 32.5% in early September. EtherFi is betting that offering native restaking yields through EigenLayer will\",\n",

       "  'Ethereum’s validator queues are empty, meaning no prospective ETH stakers currently waiting to come online. The metric indicates demand from new validators no longer exceeds the churn-rate for onboarding, with 12 validators able to come online every epoch (6.4 minutes). The queue first emptied on Oct. 13, according to Validator Queue. Ethereum developers are currently exploring reducing the churn-rate of validator onboarding. However, the exit queue for stakers is also empty, illustrating that Ethereum stakers are eager to continue collecting rewards in exchange for securing the network. The milestone attracted attention on social media, with pundits emphasizing both the drop in demand from new validators and the lack of selling from existing stakers. The news follows a big year for Ethereum, with the completion of the network’s transition to Proof of Stake last September preceding a rush of stakers coming online. Nearly 80,000 validators were still waiting to come online as August began, equating to a wait-time of 33 days. Ethereum’s Shapella upgrade also enabled stakers to exit their position and withdraw their stake for the first time in April. However, Ethereum’s exit queue has largely remained low after an initial rush, with wait times for validator withdrawals exceeding an entire on just one occasion in the past four months.

Bubblegum’s key adopter is Drip Haus, a project which allows creators to mint and airdrop NFTs. Drip has been touting Bubblegum’s compression technology since early 2023. It’s notable that a cost-saving feature has generated so much use on Solana. The blockchain already has cheap fees relative to Ethereum — even in a low-demand environment, a simple token transfer on Ethereum costs $0.63 while Solana transactions generally cost fractions of a cent. Bubblegum uses Merkle Trees, a data structure widely used across blockchains, to bring down the cost of minting the cNFTs. This is because scanning the items in a Merkle Tree scales logarithmically, meaning that minting larger numbers of NFTs results in lower costs per cNFT. To be sure, mints don’t equate to a hot market for NFTs on Solana —\\xa0data from Solscan shows volume in SOL terms for NFTs has been relatively flat over the past 90 days.

Ethereum’s recent one-year anniversary of its transition to Proof-of-Stake (POS) from mining significantly reduced its energy consumption, although it didn’t lead to a price surge. Nonetheless, Ethereum continues to be one of the most prominent cryptos. Analysts believe Ethereum can outpace Bitcoin in the coming years. According to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum’s development is 55% complete after the 2022 merge, while Bitcoin’s is at 80%. This suggests significant room for Ethereum platform growth. Scalability, with the potential for 100,000 transactions, and reduced transaction costs, could be game-changing catalysts. Of course, more development means greater risks that something will break along the way. However, for now, Ethereum’s progress in its journey to become the leading blockchain in the world has been impressive. Thus far, Ethereum remains the dominant force in decentralized',\n",

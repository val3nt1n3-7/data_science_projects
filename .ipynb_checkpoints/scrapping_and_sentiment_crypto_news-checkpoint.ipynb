Here are his four best quotes on crypto and other tech developments. Though crypto markets are rebounding in the face of promising developments like the approval of the first US spot bitcoin ETF, the sector continues to suffer the same fundamental defects, famed short-seller Jim Chanos said. In a new interview with the Institute for New Economic Thinking, the Chanos & Company founder laid out how the crypto sphere can be an avenue for financial fraud, challenges facing Tesla, and his views on the nascent artificial intelligence space. Here are the legendary short-seller\\'s best quotes from the interview: Crypto and the dark side of finance \"You have to understand that the crypto ecosystem is well-suited for the dark side of finance for a lot of reasons. It\\'s perfect for facilitating money laundering and illicit transactions. But also, there\\'s the nature of the unregulated domiciles for a lot of this activity where someone can go to basically defraud customers, whether it\\'s NFTs or ICOs or all the various types of digital flimflammery out there – it\\'s perfect.\" Bitcoin spot ETFs In Chanos\\' view, recent efforts by investing giants to establish the first US bitcoin spot ETFs are another iteration of flimflammery, with the hope of profiting from crypto\\'s high transaction fees. \"[Retail investors] think the asset price is going to go up. It\\'s like a Nasdaq stock, not a currency. So they\\'ll pay, and Wall Street wants the fees. The cost structure in crypto is quite high and so the fees are really high. You need retail investors because institutions aren\\'t going to be paying 4%',\n",

On Thursday, reports emerged BlackRock had registered the corporate entity \"iShares Ethereum Trust.\" Ether, the world\\'s second largest cryptocurrency by market cap, surged as much as 10% to hit a six-month high before paring some of its gains Friday. The ethereum-based token hovered at $2,076 around 9:00 a.m. in New York, up about 2.5%. Over the past five days, it has gained 10.5%, putting its monthly advance at 33.4%. The latest price jump followed Thursday\\'s development that BlackRock, a $8.5 trillion asset manager, had filed for a spot ether ETF with the Nasdaq exchange. Reports emerged that BlackRock also registered a corporate entity in Delaware called \"iShares Ethereum Trust,\" with iShares being the name of the company\\'s ETF division. Like bitcoin, ether has had a banner year in 2023, gaining 74%. Both tokens have skyrocketed on optimism over renewed institutional interest as players like Grayscale, Fidelity, BlackRock have already applied for a spot bitcoin ETF. \"If act one is a spot Bitcoin ETF, then act two is a spot Ethereum ETF,\" Diogo Mónica, co-founder of crypto firm Anchorage Digital, said in emailed comments. \"A spot Ethereum ETF would have a similar impact as a Bitcoin counterpart, providing a regulated and accessible wrapper for institutions and consumers to participate in the ETH ecosystem. But Ethereum adds an extra layer of intrigue as a proof-of-stake asset, which means underlying ETH could also be staked for additional rewards.\" Read the original article on Business Insider',\n",
       "  'BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has applied to launch a spot Ether exchange-traded fund (ETF) on the Nasdaq stock exchange, according to a Thursday filing. See related article: Ether breaches US$2,000 as BlackRock registers iShares Ethereum Trust entity Earlier on Thursday, BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, registered the iShares Ethereum Trust as an entity in Delaware, hinting it may be filing for a spot Ether ETF. The Ether ETF application listed Coinbase Custody as the custodian and an unnamed entity as a “cash custodian.” BlackRock filed for a spot Bitcoin ETF in the U.S. back in June. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) accepted BlackRock’s application for review in July. Thursday marked the start of an eight-day period for the SEC to “theoretically approve” pending spot Bitcoin ETF applications. Ether rose 9.5% in the 24 hours leading up to 4:40 p.m. in Hong Kong, to trade at US$2,096.

       "  \"Happy Friday. The week is ending on a high note for Ethereum, which is back in the news after financial giant BlackRock filed to launch an ETF backed by Ether, the blockchain's native currency. This led the price to jump 10%, back over the $2,000 mark, for the first time in months as investors bet that BlackRock's entry will attract billions of dollars in new capital. This development brings renewed attention to the world's second-largest cryptocurrency, which has largely been overshadowed by Bitcoin and even Solana during the long-awaited rally of the last two months. But while Ethereum boosters are rightfully enjoying the price surge, the return of the spotlight has also raised some familiar concerns. These include griping about Ethereum's transactions costs, known as gas fees, which have soared along with the burst of activity on the blockchain that has come with more trading. For long-time crypto watchers, this will bring back unpleasant memories of 2017 and 2021 when hype over Ethereum's smart contract promise led to a surge in price—followed by the blockchain slowing to a crawl, which in turn forced those who wanted to transact to pay outrageous fees. Ethereum's momentous shift last year to a proof-of-stake system was supposed to alleviate the price and congestion issues, along with so-called layer-2 solutions—sub-layers on the network that process transactions in batches and then record them on the main blockchain. The trouble is that while the layer-2 systems do indeed lower costs dramatically, they add complexity and make the Ethereum user experience—already an ordeal for those who aren't crypto diehards—even more of a headache. They are also less secure. This has led some to gripe that Ethereum should have devoted its energy to making its main network cheaper and efficient rather than outsourcing the task to other projects.

       "  'Bitcoin\\'s price has doubled since FTX collapsed a year ago. It\\'s outperforming both the S&P 500 and the \"Magnificent 7\" Big Tech stocks in 2023. Hopes that US regulators will soon approve a spot bitcoin ETF have powered the cryptocurrency to stellar gains. FTX filed for bankruptcy on November 11, 2022. Just under a year later, bitcoin isn\\'t dead – it\\'s thriving. The cryptocurrency, which remains the largest digital asset by total market cap, has more than doubled in price since Sam Bankman-Fried\\'s crypto empire crumbled, jumping 105% to just under $37,000 over the past 12 months. On Thursday, it jumped to an 18-month high after racking up a 4% surge in the space of just 24 hours. Put bitcoin\\'s gains in perspective, and its stellar rally this year feels even more impressive. The token\\'s 120% surge in 2023 means it\\'s not only beating benchmark indices like the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite –\\xa0it\\'s also outperformed the much-vaunted \"Magnificent Seven\". That increasingly-dominant group of Big Tech stocks is up 95% year-to-date, by Insider\\'s calculations. Those gains have come after a nightmarish 2022 for the entire digital-asset space. As well as the failure of FTX, crypto prices were rocked by the collapse of other big firms including stablecoin issuer Terra, lender Celsius Network, and the hedge fund Three Arrows Capital. Steadily growing speculation about the Securities and Exchange Commission potentially approving a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund has powered bitcoin\\'s comeback. On Wednesday, Bloomberg Intelligence analysts estimated there was a 90% chance that such a vehicle – which would allow big US-based institutional investors to buy crypto – would be approved before January 10. While dozens of big-name firms have filed spot ETF applications with the SEC, perhaps the highest-profile has been BlackRock, the world\\'s largest asset manager with more than',\n",

According to Lloyds, 66% of all investment scams start on social media, with Instagram and Facebook (META) the most common sources. These scams include a mix of bogus ads, fake celebrity endorsements, and the targeting of consumers through direct messages. A Lloyds spokesperson added that the number of cryptocurrency investment scams reported by victims so far this year has risen by 23%, compared to the same period in 2022.

       "  'MicroStrategy stock is up roughly 246% in 2023, and jumped more than 6% on Thursday. Founder Michael Saylor explained how bitcoin has helped the company\\'s stock compete with Big Tech giants. He said spot bitcoin ETFs and the 2024 halving event will push the token\\'s price higher. Michael Saylor, the bitcoin-bull founder and executive chairman of MicroStrategy, credits the world\\'s largest cryptocurrency for allowing his software firm to compete with the likes of Apple, Microsoft, and other of the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks. Shares of MicroStrategy have soared 246% in 2023, and on Thursday climbed 6% to trade at about $492 a share. Similarly, bitcoin — of which MicroStrategy holds billions of dollars worth in its coffers — hit a fresh high for the year on Thursday, above $37,200, and it\\'s up 122% year-to-date. To Saylor, the twin headwinds of government-induced inflation and technology-driven deflation make it difficult for companies other than the Magnificent Seven to see consistent, considerable growth. \"If you\\'re a main street company, you\\'re forced to fight for your survival with one hand tied behind your back. If you\\'re going to keep up with the Magnificent Seven you\\'re going to have to grow your revenues and cash flows at 20% a year or faster ad infinitum,\" Saylor said in a Fox Business interview earlier this week. \"There\\'s seven companies that generate all the shareholder returns. There\\'s 7,000 companies that can\\'t keep up. What we did in August of 2020 was recognize that there\\'s no way we\\'re going to outgrow Google and Microsoft and Apple Computer as a mid-sized software company.\" Saylor explained that his company began to seek out a \"high-growth digital monopoly\" to invest in, and decided bitcoin was the most promising asset. \"We realized bitcoin is like a high-tech dominant digital network growing at 40%',\n",

       "  'The latest crypto rally is \"rather overdone,\" JPMorgan wrote in a note this week. The possible launch of bitcoin spot ETFs in the US is unlikely to bring in fresh capital. Meanwhile, next year\\'s bitcoin halving event is already priced in, the analysts said. With high hopes that bitcoin can finally rocket towards a new high, long-term investors are hoarding the token at historic levels. Yet, the factors driving crypto bullishness — such as impending approval of spot ETFs and the coin\\'s upcoming halving — may end up having little impact on the token, JPMorgan analysts wrote on Wednesday. In fact, crypto\\'s recent rally is \"rather overdone,\" they said. In the past month, bitcoin has surged 32% as the SEC appears closer to approving the first bitcoin spot ETF in the US. Investing giants such as BlackRock and Fidelity are leading the efforts to establish such funds. But while crypto-enthusiasts have touted the ETFs as a way to acquaint Wall Street\\'s more traditional investors with bitcoin, JPMorgan analysts are unconvinced that this would inject fresh capital into the space. Instead, the spot ETFs would attract investment from existing bitcoin products, such as Grayscale\\'s bitcoin trust, future ETFs, and bitcoin mining companies, which tend to amass the token. \"We envisage this shift as a relative value trade as several of the above bitcoin products trade at a premium or much reduced discount relative to the past,\" the note said. As for new investors, spot ETFs existing in other countries have failed to attract impressive interest, JPMorgan noted.

Sales in the region, which generates nearly 11% of Diageo\\'s total sales, are now expected to decline by more than 20% in the six months to the end of December, the maker of Tanqueray gin and Don Julio tequila added. \"Macroeconomic pressures in the region are resulting in lower consumption and consumer downtrading,\" the world\\'s biggest spirits maker said. \"These impacts are slowing down progress in reducing channel inventory to appropriate levels for the current environment,\" it added in a statement. Shares in Diageo fell by as much as 16%, their biggest one-day drop since 1987, and were trading at 2,762 pence at 1137 GMT, the worst performer on London\\'s blue-chip index. \"Diageo has long been a favoured steady-Eddie thanks to its seemingly impenetrable brand power and dividend paying ability, and there will now be concerns that the change in appetites could translate to other, larger markets,\" said Sophie Lund-Yates, analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. Last month, Mexico\\'s Becle, the world\\'s largest tequila producer, said economic challenges in Europe and Latin America were slowing customer spending on liquor, which battered its profits. Meanwhile in Europe, Diageo said growth continues to be strong despite geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, although the pace is slower than the second half of its previous financial year, which ended on June 30. \"Over time, as inflation moderates and productivity from our supply agility program flow through, we expect operating profit to grow ahead of organic net sales growth,\" Diageo said.

Lloyds Bank (LLOY.L) has warned that a growing number of British investors risk being defrauded by a wave of fake cryptocurrency adverts posted on social media. According to Lloyds, 66% of all investment scams start on social media, with Instagram and Facebook (META) the most common sources. These scams include a mix of bogus ads, fake celebrity endorsements, and the targeting of consumers through direct messages. A Lloyds spokesperson added that the number of cryptocurrency investment scams reported by victims so far this year has risen by 23%, compared to the same period in 2022.

Founder Michael Saylor explained how bitcoin has helped the company\\'s stock compete with Big Tech giants. He said spot bitcoin ETFs and the 2024 halving event will push the token\\'s price higher. Michael Saylor, the bitcoin-bull founder and executive chairman of MicroStrategy, credits the world\\'s largest cryptocurrency for allowing his software firm to compete with the likes of Apple, Microsoft, and other of the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks. Shares of MicroStrategy have soared 246% in 2023, and on Thursday climbed 6% to trade at about $492 a share. Similarly, bitcoin — of which MicroStrategy holds billions of dollars worth in its coffers — hit a fresh high for the year on Thursday, above $37,200, and it\\'s up 122% year-to-date. To Saylor, the twin headwinds of government-induced inflation and technology-driven deflation make it difficult for companies other than the Magnificent Seven to see consistent, considerable growth. \"If you\\'re a main street company, you\\'re forced to fight for your survival with one hand tied behind your back. If you\\'re going to keep up with the Magnificent Seven you\\'re going to have to grow your revenues and cash flows at 20% a year or faster ad infinitum,\" Saylor said in a Fox Business interview earlier this week. \"There\\'s seven companies that generate all the shareholder returns.

BlackRock registered the iShares Ethereum Trust as a Delaware statutory trust on Thursday. Ethereum's price was recently up 7% at around $2,022, its highest level since April. Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, was up 2.4% at $36,450, after hitting an 18-month high earlier in the day. Earlier this year, BlackRock registered a bitcoin trust in the same manner and a week later filed an application with the SEC to launch a spot bitcoin ETF. BlackRock declined to comment on the trust's creation or on any plans for an ETF filing. To date, roughly a dozen ETF providers have filed to create spot bitcoin ETFs, or convert existing products into spot ETFs, helping fuel the recent rally in the cryptocurrency. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has so far not approved any other than ETFs tied to futures contracts, with SEC Chair Gary Gensler arguing that the spot bitcoin market is prone to fraud and manipulation.

Meanwhile, the GBTC discount – the difference between the value of a GBTC share and the value of Bitcoin backing it - continues to narrow as investors hope for the conversion of Grayscale’s closed-ended fund into an ETF.

The token is still down 83% from its all-time high of just under $260, according to Coingecko. The soaring price follows a series of announcements Solana-based developers and teams have made at the blockchain's Breakpoint conference in Amsterdam. The event stared Oct. 30 and ends Nov. 3. Significant developments include Firedancer - the ground-up rebuild of a Solana client by Jump Crypto is now live on test net. Also, the first smart wallets on Solana have gone live, thanks to the efforts of Fuse Wallet. Solana's founder, Anatoly Yakovenko, equated this progress to account abstraction on Solana. Solana data has also been integrated with Google Cloud BigQuery, Google Cloud's serverless data warehouse that is known for its machine learning, AI, and business intelligence capabilities. Adding to the rising optimism around the token is a recent report by VanEck. The investment firm predicts that by 2030 SOL could reach $3,211, outshining anticipated returns from Ethereum. The rally also comes as Sam Bankman-Fried’s trial is underway. While the disgraced FTX founder who was instrumental in supporting the Solana ecosystem is under scrutiny, it looks as if investors are now ready to move past that black spot and focus on the network's potential. Notably, market players seem to be overlooking the fact that FTX controllers have withdrawn 1.6M SOL tokens.

Lido reached the decision to leave the second-largest chain by value staked after a poll on the decision closed with 92.7% of participants voting to sunset operations on the chain. P2P Validator, the Lido on Solana development team, had so far invested ~$700,000 primarily in development and support. Their revenue during this period was around $220,000, including developer fees and milestone rewards, resulting in a net loss for Lido of ~$484,000, according to a post on the Lido forum. P2P Validator put forth a proposal to the Lido community suggesting an estimated cost of $1.5M for the next 12 months. This figure was intended to cover various expenses, including a quarterly development retainer of $200,000, an annual adoption incentive program of $600,000 and $100,000 for customer support. P2P projected that with the proposed funding, Lido on Solana could grow and secure more than 1% of the Solana staking market share. The team estimated that a 1% share of the staking market in Solana would result in treasury income of approximately 10,191 SOL over 12 months. At current prices, this amount translates to approximately $200,000. Total staked tokens on Solana are worth about $9.35B, compared with $43.7B on Ethereum, according to stakingrewards.com.
